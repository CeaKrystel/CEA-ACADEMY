										Lesson 1: Produce fish from tank aquaculture<br><br>

							Learning Objectives:<br>
							After reading this information sheet, you should be able to:<br>
							1. Prepare tank for fish farming.<br>
							2. Perform good tank preparation, care and management before and during fish cultivation.<br>
							3. Perform fish processing like daing making<br>
							<br><br>Proper tank for fish farming in the culture of various fish species is a must because it plays a very important factor in the success of fish production. 
Good pond preparations, care and management before and during fish cultivation is extremely necessary to ensure a good harvest. Proper and preparation includes the following procedures:
<br>1. Draining- done after the harvest of fish. It should be done within two weeks to allow toxic materials to evaporate.
<br>2. Poisoning- before drying the pond, poison or pesticides is applied. Poisoning is done to kill or control predators and other fish which may later on compete, disturb or hinder the growth and normal functioning of the fish.
<br>3. Screen Installation- this is done so that in washing the pond, unwanted species will not be eliminated
<br>4. Washing- done through the screened inlet gate to remove the residue of chemicals
<br>5. Liming- the application of lime to stabilize the pH value of the pond soil, it also help increase soil fertility
<br>6. Water Filling- filling the pond with clean water up to a level of 30 cm.
<br>	7. Fertilization- basal application of either organic or inorganic fertilizers in the pond is done to allow the growth of natural foods, this is done prior to stocking.

										Lesson 2: : Fish Processing<br><br>

							Learning Objectives:<br>
							After reading this information sheet, you should be able to:<br>
							1. Perform the selected product from fish processing.<br>
							2. Evaluate the finished product.<br>
							
							<br><br>Fish begins to spoil the moment it is caught and taken out of the water. To get fish to a consumer in good quality condition, fish processing and preservation is developed.
							<br>Both enzymatic digestion and bacterial decomposition play role in fish spoilage. The aim of fish processing and preservation is to slow down fish deterioration, maintaining fish fresh in good condition and as near as that of a fresh fish.
							<br>Deboned bangus is gaining popularity nowadays, it is easily to follow the steps in preparing deboned bangus.
							<br>Smoked fish is a product prepared from whole or cutfish treated with salt and subjected to smoke, oven, burning wood and other smoking materials.
							<br>Bagoong is a fish product that is commonly used as food condiments and seasoning in the Philippines and other Asean countries dishes.
							<br>Drying is the most popular method of fish preservation in the country because this method only required the heat coming from the sun. Products is commonly known as tuyo or daing.

										Lesson 3: Animation 1<br><br>

										Simple Animation using Microsoft PowerPoint<br>
										How to Add the Appear Animation<br>
										<br>
							<br><br>Step 1: Group Objects that you want to appear together.
							To make this happen, they need to be ‘grouped’. To group your objects, hold down the Shift key while clicking all the objects you want to group together. After they are all selected, click the Control + G keys to automatically group them.
							<br>Step 2: Add Animation
							Click on the object you want to add the animation to. Then, click the Animations tab in the PowerPoint ribbon. We are using the first Entrance animation, Appear, that you can see in the box.
							<br>Step 3: Preview Animation
							When you select an animation, you will see a short preview of it. With the Appear animation, it is hard to see the preview, so I suggest going into presentation mode to check it out!
							
							<br>Step 4: Repeat!
							Repeat this process for each object you want to animate. It is helpful to set up the animations in the order you want them to appear, but if you made a mistake or something needs to be changed, open the Animations Pane. Click and drag to reorder the animations.
							
							<br>Step 5: Edit Animations
							The speed and duration of the animations can be changed if the automatic settings do not fit well. Right-click on the animation in the Animations Pane and click Timing. Here, you can change the length of the animation and add any repeats if necessary.

										Lesson 4: Animation 2<br><br>

										Simple Animation using Microsoft PowerPoint<br>
										How to Add the Spin Animation to an Atom<br>
										<br>
							<br><br> Step 1: Group objects that you want to appear together.
							Once you have created the images or shapes you want to spin, you first have to group them together. Use the CTRL + G shortcut or right-click and select “Group”.
							
							Above, I’ve created an Atom diagram using PowerPoint’s shapes. I am getting a little fancy here and actually want to add two spin animations to demonstrate the outside electrons moving in one direction, and the middle electrons in another, so I’ve grouped them separately.
							
							<br>Step 2: Add Animation
							The next step is adding the Spin Animation to the two object groups. First, click on the outer electrons, then in the Animations tab, select the down arrow in the Animation box to reveal more Animations. In the Emphasis section, choose Spin.
							
							<br>Step 3: Edit Start Time of Animation
							After adding an animation, you can run it and make any edits you would like. Here, the animations automatically were set to appear one after the other, which is something I wanted to change.
							
							You can change the atom animation start time in the Animations Pane on the right by right-clicking on the animation ‘Group’. To make both animations appear at the same time, click on the second animation, the inner electrons, and choose “Start With Previous.” Here you can also change the animation to start “On Click” if you want to wait to spin your object.
							
							<br>Step 4: Edit Timing and Duration
							To make my diagram further represent the material, I also wanted to change the timing. Since these protons, neutrons, and electrons do not spin at the same rate, I can change the Spin Duration to show students!
							
							To do this, right-click on the grouped object, then choose Timing. To increase the spin speed, change the Duration to 1 second (fast!).
							
							Then to change the whole effect duration, you can edit the Repeat! I selected Repeat 3 times making the whole effect last 3 seconds.
							
							For the inner circle, I wanted to slow the speed but still match the whole animation duration. To do this, click on the inner circle animation, and in the Timing section, change the Duration to 3 seconds (slow) and do not repeat it.
							<br>Step 5: Edit Effect Options
							Lastly, you can change the animation effect, which for the Spin animation means the spin direction and amount. In the Animations tab, click on the Effect Options button.

										Lesson 5: Animation 3<br><br>

										Simple Animation using Microsoft PowerPoint<br>
										How to Use Entrance and Exit Animations Together to Show a Conversation<br>
										<br>
							<br><br> Step 1: Think Through Order of Animations & Add Them In
							Once that is set, click on the first text box, then add your entrance effect. I suggest fade or appear as they are the least distracting.
							
							Repeat for the second appearing text. Adding for the third text box is when it gets tricky.
							
							<br>Step 2: Add an Additional Animation to an Object
							Before the third text can appear, the first one has to disappear. Click on the first text box that has an animation. Then, click the “Add Animation” button on the top ribbon. From there, add the disappear animation effect. Now, you will see a number 1 & 3 next to your text box indicating the places of these animations.
							
							Repeat this for the next animations in your sequence.
							
							<br>Step 3: Change Start Time of Animations
							For the example of a conversation, I want the disappearing text and the entering replacement text to appear and disappear at the same time. For example, our 3rd and 4th animations above. Right-click on the 4th Animation in the Animation Pane and select “Start with Previous.” Now, “Hola” will disappear at the same time “Que Pasa?” is appearing.
							
							Repeat this for any other animations in your sequence.
							
							<br>Step 4: Place Text Boxes in the Correct Location
							When all the animations are completed and set in the correct order, we can move the text to exactly where we want them. We moved our text right on top of one another so they would all appear in the same place in the speech bubbles.

										Lesson 6: Animation 4<br><br>

										Simple Animation using Microsoft PowerPoint<br>
										How to Create a Motion Path Animation<br>
										<br>
							<br><br>Step 1: Add Motion Path Animation
							To show this movement of the ball, we will use two different motion path animations. Click on the ball and open the Animation choices. Scroll down until you see the Motion Path section. Select the Line option.
							
							<br>Step 2: Edit Effect Options & Placement
							The default for the Line Motion Path is down, but since I want to animate the ball being kicked up, I changed the direction of the motion path. To do this, Click on the Effect Options button and select the Up option. Now the ball moves up, but it’s still not as high as I would like. To adjust to your desired height or location, click on the red arrow and drag it to your desired location.
							
							To preview your animation as you are creating it, click on the animation star on the side of your current slide on the left slide preview panel. At this point, you should see the ball reach the ceiling.
							
							<br>Step 3: Add Custom Path Animation
							Now that the ball has reached the ceiling, I want gravity to pull it back to the floor. To make this happen, click on the ball, then the Add Animation button. Scroll down to the Motion Path animation and this time click Custom Path. This option allows you to draw a Motion Path anywhere on your slide.
							
							To start, click the spot where the ball left off at the top of the slide, draw a line down to the floor and click to add in a stop. I added a ‘stop’ to make it more realistic by having the ball hit the side of the slide (or the wall!) To do this continue drawing a line over to the edge of the slide and click to stop one last time. To finish, click the ESC button to stop creating your path.
							
							<br>Step 4: Edit Animation Effects
							After previewing your animation, there might be a couple of changes you want to make. For example:
							
							Have the Custom Path Animation to Start After Previous.
							Remove the delay between transitions by right-clicking on the animations and opening the Effect Options. Bring the smooth start and Smooth end to 0.
